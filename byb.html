        <h1>User Experience Consultant</h1>
        <p>For the University of Michigan's <em>SI 622: Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluation</em> course, I worked with three classmates to act as UX consultants for our assigned client, Backyard Brains.<br><br>Throughout the semester, we supported our client by conducting research, distilling findings, crafting recommendations, and holding weekly readouts to help communicate our work. Our semester concluded with high level findings that would help them meet their goals while ensure a more fulfilling user experience.</p>

Some stated they didn't know where to start while others indicated they didn't know what products were right for them. Although the users have different needs, the website was not equipped to handle all of these needs effectively.<br><br>To illustrate these different users and use cases, we created personas and user scenarios.

              These features are commonly found across sites, particularly in the comparitor set where seven of the eights comparators had implemented both of these features on their own websites. Not having these features can erect unnecessary obstacles, while utlilizing them inconsistently can be confusing.

            <p class="finding_one_three">In the card sorting activity, all participants placed Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced together, and 42% placed these cards together under an “Experiments” header.<br><br>Meanwhile, 85% of participants placed Top Kits for Educators, Top Kits for Students, and Top Kits for Enthusiasts together, while 30% placed these cards together under a “Store” header.<br><br>Together, these suggest that users expect some level of segmentation, sorting and filtering on sites they visit.</p>

              <p>According to our heuristic evaluation, the Backyard Brains website violated the “User Control and Freedom” and “Flexibility and Efficiency of Use” heuristics. All team members pointed to a lack of searching and filtering for this violation. Our heuristic evaluations revealed that locating information within the Backyard Brains website can be difficult for those unfamiliar with the website, and even those that do have some level of familiarity. In combination with previous findings, we decided to explore this in the usability study.

              Although there are filter and sort options on the experiments page, the usability study exposed that these are not useful to users. Grade-level based filters proved to be an onstacle when users tried to locate an experiment for specific products.

              When guaging customer satisfaction across product set up, product usage, site product information, site experiments, site troubleshooting materials and site videos, survey results were generally positive for set up and site features. However, there was a relatively higher rate of dissatisfaction for troubleshooting material, particularly amongst teachers.

              Most of the more successful comparators offered troubleshooting materials in the form of How-to-Videos as well as written documentation. They also utilized alternative forms made available through community forums and product reviews. Some comparators even offered a FAQ page to address known troubleshooting challenges.

Some users said they contact Backyard Brains in order to ask their questions, while others stated they needed product recommendations.

              Our comparative analysis revealed that the Product Reviews, Communities and Forums, as well as Product Recommendations were used to help communicate information to users. LittleBits, PSCO, and Udemy were particularly effective at integrating these features into their respective platforms.

            <p class="finding_three_three">During the usability study, we asked participants which ecommerce sites they use. All participants stated Amazon was one of their primary websites for online shopping. Many of them stated that the product reviews, rating systems, and recommendations on Amazon were important when making online purchasing decisions.
