        <h1>iWorker</h1>
        <p>As part of the University of Michigan's <em>SI 582: Introduction to Interaction Design</em> course, I created a prototype for an app called iWorker.<br><br>The objective of the course was to teach methods and skills involved in designing and prototyping interactive systems. Each student pursued their own project during the semester, using the design process to guide their process. Individually, students determined a problem space all the way through to creating a digital prototype.</p>

        <h1 class="problem_space_header">Identifying Problem Space</h1>
          <p class="problem_space_intro">As an analyst at Nielsen I got my first experience with remote and distributed work. After discussing my experience with some of my friends who also had exposure working remote, I realized there was a gap for iWorkers, more specifically the disparity between their needs and what was available. While some don't mind working from their homes, those that traveled extensively didn't always have that option, while others felt they were less productive in their homes.</p>

          <p class="problem_space_stat1">But it wasn't just my friends and I that were having this problem. From 2005 to 2018 there was a <a href = "https://www.skipthedrive.com/21-statistics-about-remote-work-trends-in-2018/" target="_blank">140%</a> increase in telecommuters, and does not include those self-employed (i.e., freelancers and gig workers).<br><br>On top of that, the US had <a href = "https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics" target="_blank">about 4.3 million remote works</a> in 2018, which was about 3.2% of the non-self employed, working population.</p>
          <img src="images/iworker/graph1.png" alt="Graph showing 140% increase in telecommuters between 2005 and 2018." class="problem_space_graph1">

          <p class="problem_space_stat2">What made this an even more compelling problem space was that studies suggested that the trend towards remote work was set to continue. One study by Odesk,<a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2013/04/01/flexible-workspaces-another-workplace-perk-or-a-must-have-to-attract-top-talent/#5606b2d42ce7" target="_blank"> projected 1 in 3 employed people in the US</a> would be remote works by 2020.</p>
          <img src="images/iworker/graph2.png" alt="Graph showing that 33% of workers in the US are expected to work remote by 2020." class="problem_space_graph2">
